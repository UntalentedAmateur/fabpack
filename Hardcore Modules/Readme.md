## Hardcore Modules

Installed after the System and Baseline sets for gaming on Hardcore worlds.  While some mods may allow QOL (Quality of Life) changes that might be considered cheating (i.e. anything other than pure vanilla Minecraft), they can be managed effectively through the server-side configuration files to ensure that vanilla effects are still felt for activating those specific functions / abilities / capabilities.

There are no dedicated mods that are applied beyond the baseline configuration, just specific configuration settings.
