# Shader Packs

Without Optifine, the alternative that provides broad shader support for the Fabric modloader is [Iris](https://irisshaders.net).  There are a wide range of shaders that are supported, with the intent to achieve feature parity with present and past versions of Optifine, and to be compatible with as many mods as possible.

A number of shaders have been tested as functional with the mod pack, and which shader you elect to use (if you use one), is a personal choice.  I personally use [Sildur's Vibrant Shaders Lite (1.32)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/sildurs-vibrant-shaders), tuned so that it looks more realistic than cartoony.  My specific shader settings are under Shader Packs/Configs.  That text file can be placed in the shaderpacks folder alongside the main shader .zip and Iris will apply the contained settings when shaders are next loaded.

With earlier versions of Iris, Sodium, and Minecraft, I was using Sildur's Enhanced Default, but have been able to get a comfortable 60+ fps with my Vibrant Lite settings.
