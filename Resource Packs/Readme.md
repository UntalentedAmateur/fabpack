# Resource Packs

There are quite a number of resource packs that will happily work with the Fabric modloader, and which one you use is largely down to personal preference.  With the different mods present, the added blocks that they introduce can be jarring if some of the more heavily modified / abstract resource packs are used.  Newer versions may be available, but the listed versions are those that were tested and seemed to have a decent visual impact without too much performance detriment, combined with active shaders and mods.

There is a separate section for FabricSkyboxes converted skybox packs, due to the different method for handling skybox rendering between FabricSkyboxes and Optifine.  The Hyper Realistic Skybox pack is already available in a Fabric-compatible version direct from Curseforge.

Personally, I play with:
- Soartex_Fanver
- OrchestraSoundpack
- Hyper Realistic Sky
